  - **Logisim** folder: Contains images of most circuits and a Logisim file to explore the circuit.
- **HDL** folder: Contains files related to Hardware Description Language (HDL).
  - **Design** folder: Contains HDL files that describe the circuit designs or modules.
  - **Dump** folder: Stores output files or logs generated during the simulation or synthesis process.
  - **Testbench** folder: Stores HDL files with testbenches used for verifying the circuit functionality.
- **GDS** folder: Contains files related to the Graphic Data System (GDS) format, commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing.

# Methodology

1. **Algorithm Design**: Begin by designing and implementing the algorithm in Python. Clearly define the problem statement, determine the required inputs and outputs, and develop an efficient algorithmic solution using Python programming language.

2.  **Schematic Design**: Create schematics using a tool Logisim based on the algorithm in python.
   
4. **Translate Algorithm to Verilog**: Once the algorithm in Python is finalized, the next step is to translate it into hardware using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog. Write Verilog modules that represent the functionality of the algorithm. Define the input and output ports, internal logic, and any required control signals within the Verilog modules.

5. **Testbench Development**: Create a testbench in Verilog to verify the functionality of the Verilog modules. The testbench should include test vectors that cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure proper operation of the design. The testbench will generate stimulus for the design and capture the expected outputs for comparison.

6. **Simulate and Verify**: Use a Verilog simulator, such as ModelSim or VCS, to simulate the Verilog design with the testbench. Run the simulation and analyze the waveform results to verify that the design operates correctly and produces the expected outputs for the given inputs. Debug any issues that arise during simulation.

7. **RTL to GDS Conversion**: Once the design is verified at the RTL (Register Transfer Level) level, the next step is to convert it into a GDS (Graphic Data System) file, which represents the physical layout of the design. OpenLANE is an open-source software tool that automates the RTL to GDS conversion flow. Configure and run OpenLANE with the required design specifications and constraints to generate the GDS file.

# Tools Used

1. **EDA Playground**: EDA (Electronic Design Automation) Playground is an online platform that provides a web-based environment for designing and simulating digital circuits. It allows you to write and simulate HDL code (such as Verilog or VHDL) directly in your browser, making it convenient for learning and experimenting with digital designs.

2. **OpenLane**: OpenLane is an open-source digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) flow that assists in the entire ASIC design process. It provides a complete RTL-to-GDSII (Register Transfer Level to Graphic Data System II) design flow, including synthesis, placement, and routing. OpenLane is often used for designing and manufacturing integrated circuits.

3. **Logisim**: Logisim is a graphical tool used for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. It allows you to create circuits using a drag-and-drop interface and simulate their behavior. Logisim supports various components, including logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and more. It is commonly used for educational purposes and small-scale digital circuit design.

4. **GTKWave**: GTKWave is a waveform viewer that allows you to visualize and analyze simulation waveforms. It supports various simulation formats, such as VCD (Value Change Dump) or FST (Fast Signal Trace). GTKWave provides features for zooming, searching, and examining signals in the waveform. It is often used in conjunction with HDL simulators to analyze the behavior of digital designs.
